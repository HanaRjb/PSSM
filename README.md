# PSSM Matrix Generator

This repository contains a Python script for generating a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) from amino acid sequences in a FASTA file. The PSSM can be used in various bioinformatics analyses.

## Features

- Reads amino acid sequences from a FASTA file.
- Constructs a PSSM matrix based on amino acid frequencies.
- Outputs the PSSM matrix for further analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

## Usage

1. Place your input FASTA file named `H_train.txt` in the project directory.
2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

3. The PSSM matrix will be computed. Uncomment the relevant lines in the script to save the output to a CSV file named `pssm_H_train.csv`.

## Code Overview

The main steps in the code include:

- Importing necessary libraries.
- Reading the FASTA file using a custom `readFasta` module.
- Generating the PSSM matrix based on amino acid frequencies.
- The final matrix can be saved to a CSV file for analysis.

### Example

Here is a snippet of how the PSSM is generated:

```python
def PSSM(fastas, **kw):
    AA = "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"
    encodings = []
    for i in fastas:
        name, sequence = i[0], i[1]
        encodings.append(sequence)
    # Further PSSM calculations...
```
